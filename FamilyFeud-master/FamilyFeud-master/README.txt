A C# Family Feud board with graphics inspired by the original Richard Dawson series.

This is still very much a work in progress and can't really be used to play real games
until much later on.

Requres .NET 4.5 and the Visual Basic PowerPacks (for one silly line in the MCP) so
make sure you have the VB PowerPacks DLL if you're running Visual Studio 2013.

Surveys are stored in XML format; see FF\notbin\text.xml for an example survey XML
file. The front-end of the game board stores its images in FF\notbin\data\rounds\normal
for surveys and all other graphics in FF\notbin\data\gfx. Copy the contents of notbin to 
FF\bin\<build type> in order to run.

Sounds are located in FF\notbin\data\sounds. They're recorded in Microsoft WAV format.
Some sounds used are from the Freesound project, others are ones I recorded myself.
